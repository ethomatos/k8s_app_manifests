The Dockerfile uses a pure Python container with requirements for the modules needed.
Then the container runs the Python script and places the script and requirements and
required token file inside the container filesystem.

The Dockerfile.old uses an Alpine Linux OS container to run the Python script as if
it was being hosted in a Linux system, only it runs as a container using crontab.
In this use case, the init.vars and token file are used inside the Linux container
and the Python scripts reads in the files.
